# Getting data into R

Materials for the Getting Data into R R-Ladies RTP meetup. 

Sign up at https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/

While the materials for the workshop are designed for being used at the in-person 
workshop, all are welcomed to use and reuse them for learning and teaching.

The slides for the workshop can be found here: http://rpubs.com/eamcvey/rladies-rtp-data-import

This workshop assumes no background in R but willingness to learn a scripting
language.

The focus of the workshop is on data import, not data manipulation or analysis.

All R-Ladies events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. 
We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend as guests.
